# Phototagger
Build-up a phototagger application for home use

## Background 

This is a small, passion project to allow easy categorization of family photos.  The most pressing (and most interesting) usecase for me 
is building-up an index of images that contain families and friends.

Note:  While cloud-based solutions from Microsoft and Google offer far better performance, a couple of must-haves are containing cost and retaining privacy.  

## Dependencies
- Accord.Net
- .NET Framework 4.7.2

## Future plans
- Add face extractors, to quickly compile large list of faces to train
- Add face classifier, to only detect faces I care about (see https://github.com/accord-net/framework/issues/1018#issuecomment-342293953)
- Add data store support to allow storage of classifier(s)
- Add Synology Assistance support
