# Phototagger
Build-up a phototagger application for home use

## Future plans
- Add face extractors, to quickly compile large list of faces to train
- Add face classifier, to only detect faces I care about (see https://github.com/accord-net/framework/issues/1018#issuecomment-342293953)
- Add data store support to allow storage of classifier(s)
- Add Synology Assistance support
